### Neural network

This project comprises of designing and coding a neural network from scratch with Python.
It contains the following steps:

1. Coding a layer
2. Coding layers, batches and objects
3. Hidden layer activation functions
4. Softmax activation function (for output layer); Exponentiation and normlization
5. Calculating loss with categorical cross-entropy
6. Implementing loss
